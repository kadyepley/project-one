Project Descriptions / Outline 

This project investigates comprehensive insights into the relationship between water usage and temperature variation, as well as the impact of seasons on water consumption patterns in Austin, by analyzing historical data between 2013 and 2017. We will examine how water usage is affected by different seasons throughout the year.

Research Questions to Answers

Determine wheather is there any relationship between avrage monthly water usage in Austin and the variation in temperature by analyzing historical data between 2013 and 2017

Question 1
Determine wheather is there any relationship between avrage monthly water usage in Austin and the variation in temperature by analyzing historical data between 2013 and 2017

Step 1:
    - Load data from  CVS file and convert them to data frames for both water consuption data and weather data.
    - Process raw data, by getting rid of all unwanted information, and selecting  water consuption data from only 2013 to 2022017.
    - Convert dates in the dataset to match their date format
    - Calculate the average temperature for each month in the weather dataset, as the data is provided for every day.
    - calculate the total water consumption for each month, as data provided for the total water consumption categorized by zip code and customer class.
    - Merge two data sets
