Project title:
Determining the Relationship between Temperature Variation and Water Usage Patterns in Austin

Team Members:
Joel Rodriguez, Kady Epley, Sujatha Angajala

Project Description/Outline:

This project aims to explore the relationship between water usage and temperature variation in Austin, as well as the impact of seasons on water consumption patterns. We will analyze historical data from 2013 to 2017 to gain comprehensive insights into these factors.

Research Questions to Answer:

Is there a relationship between average monthly water usage in Austin and temperature variation? (2013-2017 data)
How does water usage change throughout the year across different seasons?

Which zip codes in the Austin metro area have the highest total monthly water consumption in gallons? (2013-2017 data)

How does the total monthly water usage differ among the predominant customer classes (Residential, Multi-Family, and Irrigation) within each zip code?
Datasets to be Used (timeframe: 2017 to 2022):

Data from data.austintexas.gov on water consumption
Austin Weather dataset from Kaggle
Rough Breakdown of Tasks:

Everyone: Data collection, cleaning, and plotting
Kady: GitHub/Organization
Everyone: Presentation
Question 1:
Is there a relationship between average monthly water usage in Austin and temperature variation? (2013-2017 data)

Step 1:

Load water consumption data and weather data from CSV files and convert them into data frames.
Process the raw data by removing unnecessary information and selecting water consumption data only from 2013 to 2017.
Adjust the date format to match the dataset's date format.
Calculate the average temperature for each month in the weather dataset (since it provides daily data).
Calculate the total water consumption for each month, considering the data categorized by zip code and customer class.
Merge the two datasets.
